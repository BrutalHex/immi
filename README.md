## Run

`npm start`

##features
the solution works based on business rules. if any pokemon not found
then it **redirects** to main page. it's **responses** well to small screens. 
it has **docker** file which hosts project in **ngnix**.
it has **unit tests** to check the actions.
I have used these too :

 1. Axios
 2. Image Lazy loading
 3. **spinner** shows up for API calls
 4. Thunk
 5. Router
 6. useState and useSelector **hooks**
 7. action creators
 8. a default **enhancer** and **middleware** just for show
 9. a **Sass** file with a mixin and variables
 10. **HOC**
 11. **EsLint** and **prettier**
 12. react router
 13. no TypeScript
 14. some unused features like uuid to show the separation of concerns and project 
 file organization.(rails mostly)


 
 ## Test
 `npm test`
